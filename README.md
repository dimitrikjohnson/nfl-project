# 🏈 Big Football

[Big Football](https://www.bigfootball.co) is a modern web application built with Next.js, designed to deliver dynamic NFL content. Each team has its own dashboard featuring:

- 📅 Game schedules and results
- 📊 Team and player statistics
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Full rosters
- 🏆 Conference and division standings

Additionally, each player has his own dashboard featuring:

- 📈 Stats from the current (or the player's most recent) season
- 📜 Team history
- 📊 Career stats
- 📰 Latest news

The app uses dynamic routing, type safety, and modular React components to ensure maintainability and avoid code duplication. 

All data is courtesy of ESPN's NFL API, and a curated list of many of the available endpoints can be found on [@nntrn's GitHub page](https://gist.github.com/nntrn/ee26cb2a0716de0947a0a4e9a157bc1c#scoreboard-api).
