# Big Football 🏈

Big Football is a modern web application built with Next.js, designed to deliver dynamic, team-focused NFL content. Each team has its own dashboard featuring:

- 📅 Game schedules and results
- 📊 Team and player statistics
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Full rosters
- 🏆 Conference and division standings

The app uses dynamic routing, strong type safety, and modular React components to ensure performance and maintainability. 

All data is courtesy of ESPN's NFL API, and a curated list of many of the available endpoints can be found on [@nntrn's GitHub page](https://gist.github.com/nntrn/ee26cb2a0716de0947a0a4e9a157bc1c#scoreboard-api).
